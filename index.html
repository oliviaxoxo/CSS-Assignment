    <p>The Internet is one of the world’s most important sources of data that is used worldwide.
         People from across the globe communicate with one another through the Internet.
          Whether it’s watching a movie or catching up with an old friend,
         the Internet has made everything easier. It has also made us more productive and has made life so much easier.
         It is hard to pinpoint precisely what causes internet addiction. But it is known that it can be easily compared to other types of addictions with the sort of dependency it causes.
          Internet addiction is a more recent phenomenon, and the causes can vary with gender, age, and personality.
          Social circles play a critical role in causing behavioral issues like addiction. Internet addiction is no exception, as constant internet surfing has become commonplace among the youth. 
          There is even an encouragement to seek friends online while playing online games, chat rooms, or just on social media.

          The Internet can also become a coping-mechanism for self-soothing and as an escape for those who are suffering from mental health issues and such. 
          The same way that people who suffer from depression or anxiety use alcohol and drugs to self-medicate, the Internet can be a distraction. 
         Be it by playing video games, watching shows, or merely surfing forums.</p>
